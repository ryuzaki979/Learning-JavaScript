//if and else is connected.
//when you know that there is only two logic in a thing you can use else.

//in previous tutorial we written two if condition for n is even or Odd.

let n =10;

if(n%2===0){
    console.log(n+ " is Even");
}
if(n%2===1){
    console.log(n+ " is Odd");
}
//we can write the code in this way.
if(n%2===1){
    console.log(n+ " is Odd");
}else{
    console.log(n+ " is Even"); 
}
